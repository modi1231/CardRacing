The rules are fairly straight forward.

 [u][b]Rules:[/u][/b]
 Standard 52 card deck.
 Arrange the aces in a horizontal line face up.
 Shuffle the deck.
 Pull out 5 cards, face down, and arrange them vertically (perpendicular) to the aces.  Start one row above the aces.
 Each turn consists of: 
 -- pulling the top card from the draw pile, 
 -- revealing the card
 -- move the corresponding suit's ace up one row.
 
 The win condition: first ace to cross the line wins.
 
 [u][b]Extra rules:[/u][/b]
 When one ace is the last in a given row, and there is a face down row card, show that card.
 Move that corresponding suit's ace BACK one spot.
 Discard the card.
